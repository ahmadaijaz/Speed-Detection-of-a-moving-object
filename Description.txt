
Description:
1) Firstly we have read a video.
2) Then we have made the frames of the video.
3) We have taken the first frame.
4) We have taken the last frame(i.e the frame in which the last time complete pic of car was visible).
5) We have found the COA of both the frames and found the pixel distance.
6) A we know 1 pixel = 0.0002645833 m, so we have converted the pixel distance to metre distance.
7) Then we have divided that distance with time.

PS: For time we have divided the total frames by 27 , because in 1 second, 27 frames are generated 
so we started the counter till the last frame created. Then we divided that counter by 27 to get the time in seconds
The speed is in metre per second.
